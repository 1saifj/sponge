## Automated Testing of 5 Service Codes Generated by Sponge

### Dependency Setup

- MySQL service: create at least one database and one table. Then, fill in the variables `mysqlDSN` and `mysqlTable` in `1_web_gin.sh` and `2_micro_grpc.sh`.
- Install Sponge.
- Compile the `replaceCode` code using Go, then move the binary file to a directory in the system's path.

### Testing

```bash
# Test web service generated based on SQL
bash 1_web_gin.sh

# Test gRPC service generated based on SQL
bash 2_micro_grpc.sh

# Test web service generated based on Protobuf
bash 3_web_gin_pb.sh

# Test gRPC service generated based on Protobuf
bash 4_micro_grpc_pb.sh

# Test gRPC gateway service generated based on Protobuf
bash 5_grpc_gateway_pb.sh
```

After testing, remove the code generated during the testing process.

```bash
bash clean.sh
```

## Generate Command Test

A total of 13 service codes are generated, including web, grpc, grpc gateway services

```bash
bash generate_test.sh
```

After testing, remove the code generated code.

```bash
bash clean_generate.sh
```
